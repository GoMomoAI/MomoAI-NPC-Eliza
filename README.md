# MomoAI-NPC-Eliza 🤖✨  
**Revolutionizing Gaming with AI-Powered NPCs and the Eliza Framework**

---

## 🌌 Introduction  
Welcome to **MomoAI-NPC-Eliza**, an open-source project that combines the cutting-edge capabilities of the **Eliza framework** with the innovative vision of **MomoAI 3.0**.  

Our mission is to redefine gaming by creating **living, evolving virtual worlds** powered by AI, Web3, and decentralized technologies.

## 🚀 Features  

### 1. AI-Powered NPCs  
- **Context-Aware Interactions**: NPCs respond dynamically to player input using state-of-the-art AI models (OpenAI, Llama, Anthropic, etc.).  
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: NPCs can interact with each other and players, fostering emergent gameplay.

### 2. Web3 Integration  
- **Self-Tradable Wallets**: NPCs are equipped with their own Web3 wallets.  
- **Decentralized Transactions**: NPCs can trade, create, and interact with blockchain assets (NFTs, tokens, etc.).  

### 3. Dynamic Scene Generation  
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: NPCs and game environments evolve based on player actions.  
- **Procedural Worlds**: Every interaction leads to a unique, immersive experience.

### 4. Developer-Friendly Framework  
- **Built on Eliza**: Leverage the robust, extensible Eliza framework for AI agent development.  
- **Fully Modular**: Customize NPC behaviors, add new AI models, and extend functionality with ease.  
- **Web3 Ready**: Plug-and-play support for blockchain networks and decentralized systems.

## 📖 Why MomoAI-NPC-Eliza?  

Traditional NPCs are static, predictable, and limited by pre-defined rules, making them feel artificial and disconnected. **MomoAI-NPC-Eliza** changes this by integrating:  

1. **Eliza Framework**: A battle-tested multi-agent AI framework with support for various AI models and plugins.  
2. **MomoAI 3.0 Innovations**: Self-sustaining NPCs that can think, trade, and evolve, creating truly immersive gameplay.  
3. **Web3 Technologies**: Enabling NPCs to become autonomous participants in the in-game economy.  

We’re building a future where NPCs are no longer "just characters"—they’re **intelligent digital entities** coexisting with players.

## 🎯 Use Cases  

Here are some of the transformative use cases enabled by **MomoAI-NPC-Eliza**:  

- **Immersive Game Worlds**: Populate your game with intelligent NPCs that evolve and adapt in real time.  
- **Decentralized Economies**: Create self-sustaining NPCs capable of trading, crafting, and participating in blockchain-driven economies.  
- **Autonomous Agents**: Use NPCs as autonomous agents in simulations, business processes, or research.  
- **AI-Driven Storytelling**: Generate dynamic narratives based on player choices and NPC interactions.
