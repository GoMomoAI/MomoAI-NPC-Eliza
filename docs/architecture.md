# Architecture Overview üèóÔ∏è

## Introduction
The architecture of **MomoAI-NPC-Eliza** is designed to enable the creation of intelligent, autonomous NPCs that interact seamlessly with players and other agents in an evolving virtual world. This document outlines the core components and their interactions within the system.

---

## Core Components

### 1. **Eliza Framework**
At the heart of the project is the Eliza Framework, a robust, multi-agent AI system that supports integration with state-of-the-art AI models. It provides the foundation for NPC behavior, communication, and decision-making.

---

### 2. **Agent Logic**
- **NPC Behavior Modules**: Located in `src/agents/`, these modules define the logic and personality of each NPC. Key files include:
  - `defaultAgent.ts`: Implements the default NPC behavior.
  - `customAgent.ts`: Allows for custom behavior extensions.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: NPCs interact not only with players but also with each other, enabling emergent gameplay scenarios.

---

### 3. **AI Models**
The system integrates various AI models to power NPC intelligence. These include:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding and generating player-facing dialogues.
- **Decision-Making Models**: To simulate realistic NPC choices and actions.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: For adaptive NPC behaviors that evolve over time.

---

### 4. **Web3 Integration**
The project leverages Web3 technologies to create decentralized, self-sustaining NPCs:
- **NPC Wallets**: Each NPC is equipped with its own Web3 wallet, enabling interactions with blockchain-based economies.
- **Smart Contracts**: Facilitate trading, crafting, and other in-game economic activities.

---

### 5. **Services and Utilities**
- **Service Layer**: Handles communication between NPCs and external systems, including Web3 nodes and APIs.
- **Utility Functions**: Located in `src/utils/`, these provide shared functionalities for the application.

---

## System Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The system initializes by loading NPC configurations from the `src/agents/` directory.
   - Environment variables are loaded from `.env` for customization.

2. **AI Model Integration**:
   - NPCs leverage pre-trained AI models for decision-making and dialogue generation.

3. **Gameplay Interaction**:
   - Players interact with NPCs through natural language inputs.
   - NPCs respond dynamically based on context and predefined logic.

4. **Web3 Transactions**:
   - NPCs execute blockchain-based actions such as trading or crafting using their Web3 wallets.

---

## Scalability and Modularity
The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable:
- **Add New NPCs**: Simply create a new agent file in `src/agents/` and define its behavior.
- **Integrate New Models**: Swap or add AI models with minimal changes to the existing codebase.
- **Expand Web3 Features**: Introduce new smart contracts or decentralized services without disrupting core functionality.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Model Improvements**: Integration of more advanced AI models for enhanced NPC intelligence.
- **Dynamic Learning**: Enable NPCs to learn and adapt based on player interactions.
- **Extended Web3 Features**: Support for cross-platform economies and decentralized governance.

By building on these components, **MomoAI-NPC-Eliza** aims to push the boundaries of intelligent NPC design and create an immersive, player-driven experience.
