# NPC Innovation Design ðŸŽ®

## Overview
The NPC (Non-Playable Character) system in **MomoAI-NPC-Eliza** is built to revolutionize the way virtual characters interact with players and the digital environment. By leveraging advanced AI and Web3 technologies, our NPCs are designed to be dynamic, context-aware, and capable of evolving over time.

## Design Principles

### 1. **Context-Awareness**
NPCs can understand and respond to player actions and dialogue within the context of the ongoing scenario. This is achieved through:
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Interprets player inputs in real-time.
- **Scenario Context Memory**: Maintains a history of interactions to deliver coherent responses.

### 2. **Personality-Driven Behaviors**
Each NPC is imbued with a unique personality and behavior model, which includes:
- **Emotional States**: NPCs can exhibit emotions such as joy, anger, or sadness based on interactions.
- **Behavioral Traits**: Traits such as curiosity or hostility influence NPC decision-making.

### 3. **Dynamic Evolution**
NPCs evolve over time based on:
- **Player Interactions**: Frequent interactions shape the NPC's behavior.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: NPCs adapt to optimize their performance in various scenarios.

### 4. **Web3 Integration**
NPCs are augmented with Web3 functionalities, enabling them to:
- Own and trade digital assets using their Web3 wallets.
- Participate in on-chain activities, such as crafting and governance.
